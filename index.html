                Stick shift cars had been dying for decades. Automakers were slowly removing them from their lineups. 
                Most consumers would opt for the automatic because it was more fuel efficient, easier to drive (especially in traffic), 
                and more reliable. They were about to become extinct until 2021, when the pandemic hit and nostalgia for the past was born.

                        From the 1980s onward, automatic transmissions became increasingly sophisticated and fuel-efficient.
                        Consumer preferences shifted toward convenience, and manual transmissions began their long march toward obsolescence.

                <p class="section-description">
                    Post-pandemic life (2022 and onward) sparked a renewed appreciation and nostalgia for the manual transmission. 
                    In a world of Teslas taking over and cars losing their soul, the post pandemic brought about 
                    a loud craving for something real. A rebellion began, not with signs, but with shift knobs and 3 pedals. 
                    The #SaveTheManuals movement became a rally cry for those who refused to let the soul of driving die. 
                    It was a conscious choice to master a dying art, to feel the raw, mechanical connection that a computer could never replicate.

                        Like a mechanical watch or a vinyl record, the manual is a cherished analog experience. 
                        But choosing one today—knowing it's less efficient, objectively slower, and a hassle in 
                        traffic—isn't just a preference. It's a bold statement that the experience of driving 
                        will always matter more than the numbers.
